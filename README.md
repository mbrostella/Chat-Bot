# Chat-Bot

The Watson Cognitive Challenge asked me and my group to create a chatbot using the Watson chat bot app. We created a bot that could help a person choose their desireable character in an RPG. A python notebook was used in order to score the different answers based on personality (aggressive, kind, etc) in order to select the characteristics of the character that best fits the personality of the player.
